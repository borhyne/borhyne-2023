Here's a cool visualization using d3.js, dc.js and crossfilter.js along with Yelp and Census Data to find breweries close by. 

Last summer, I launched a product that used sales data from restaurants along with Census demographic data and other data sources to calculate the odds of success for a new restaurant location. We used Tableau for the visualization, but I wanted to learn some open source softwares so I dove into this project:

### What can it do?
On this dashboard you can find breweries based on filters like: number of yelp reviews, yelp rating, population density and median income.

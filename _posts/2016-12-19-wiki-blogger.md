After a recent Django meetup I saw an easy and cheap path to mock up an idea I've been working on. The post below shows my dive into creating a MEAN stack app to crowdsource and rank travel blogs (something I wish I had this summer in Asia).

### The Maize App
Two weeks ago I went to a Django meetup where the presentation was on the Maize App stack, which is a locally run project to find nearby food trucks. The CTO of the project presented on their stack (picture below) which they were able to set up for $20.

*They use Ionic, but React Native is a pretty similar tool*

### My Project
After hearing the presentation on the Maize App, I realized mocking up my idea was easily attainable. After looking at several projects I found that the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) would be the easiest for me to understand after recently learning d3, dc and crossfilter and also spending a lot of time working with JSON.

Additionally, I figured out how to host on Heroku and instantly show new data once submitted. Check it out.. you just move the marker where you want to add a point and put the details in with it:

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions. I'm working on adding filtering and voting buttons to help find the best content.

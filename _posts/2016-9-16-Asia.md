title: A summer in Asia
---

After finishing my MBA in May, I went to Asia to explore a part of the world I had never been to with my girlfriend, Whitney. We loved exploring new cultures and trying to get off the beaten path as often as possible. 

Whitney and I traveled through Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia from May until September of 2016.

### What was your favorite place?

#### Nepal
In Nepal we did the Everest Base Camp trek. Being surrounded by the Himalayas for two weeks was unlike any hiking I've ever done. Whitney and would both love to get back to Nepal to do the Annapurna and Manaslu Circuit Treks.

#### Indonesia
If you went to an island a day in Indonesia it would take you 49 years to go to all of them. Everywhere we went there were volcanoes, beaches, monkeys and world class scuba diving.

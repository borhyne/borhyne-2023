title: Everest Base Camp
---

After finishing bschool, I went to Asia to see a new side of the world. After stopping through New Delhi - the next stop was Everest.

We did a two week trek from Lukla to Base Camp then crossing the Cho La Pass. Aside from getting altitude sickness, this was one of the most incredible things I've been able to do.

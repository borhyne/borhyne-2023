**How did you get from Physics into ML?**\
Today's Machine Learning is very much an empirical profession, which means that we learn simply by experimentation, using the scientific method. Much of what I've been doing as a Physicist was empirical as well, and that experience prepared me well for working in ML. However, besides the skills needed, the more important part is networking: I was lucky enough to meet my future manager from JP Morgan Chase at a networking event hosted by the University of Chicago while I was still a postdoc.

**Why do you write?**\
A few reasons:
- I write to learn. Writing forces you to really understand a concept. If you can't write it down in a paragraph, that means that you haven't understood it well enough yet.
- I write to create an online portfolio that may open up future opportunities. 
- I write to build a second income stream. For example, Medium pays me a fraction of their subscription fees as royalties.

**Do you have any tips for getting started with writing?**\
Yes! Check out my post here:\

**What's the architecture of this site?**\
It's using Jekyll, Github Pages, and a Google domain. You can find the source code on my [github](https://github.com/sflender/site).  

**What's the best way to get in touch?**\
Email me: samuel dot flender at googlemail dot com.

**Why is your Email googlemail, not gmail?**\
I get that a lot. When gmail was introduced in Germany, that domain name was already taken. It took a few year for Google to make it available, and so they gave users the googlemail domain. Today I can use both googlemail and gmail, so I effectively have 2 Email addresses in one.

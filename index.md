This website provides a central place for some projects. In 2020, I leaned in to some work I'd wanted to do like starting a company [Current Sets](https://currentsets.com/){:target="_blank"} and picked up the guitar. Both have been a long time coming!

## [Models](/site/models/)
My goal here is to map out decision making and lessons and create an interactive way to sort through it.

## [Guitar](/site/guitar/)
This has been helpful to visualize the ways notes are organized and to simulate some fingerpicking songs I've been learning on acoustic guitar.

##[Current Sets](/site/cs/)
Current Sets help people improve their construction documents before starting construction. As of mid 2023, we've reviewed 220+ projects and saved people a lot of money on avoided rework, change orders, and schedule delays.

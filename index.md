This is a central place for some projects.

## [Guitar](/guitar/)
A programmatic way to help practice fingerpicking songs I've been learning on acoustic guitar.

## [Models](/models/)
An interactive way to sort through mental models.

## [Current Sets](/cs/)
We've built a platform to help buildings check and improve coordination and design quality and have made a lot of progress since starting in late 2020.

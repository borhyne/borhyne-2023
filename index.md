This website provides a central place for some projects. In 2020, I leaned in to some work I'd wanted to do like starting a company [Current Sets](https://currentsets.com/) and picked up the guitar. Both have been a long time coming!

## Mental models
My goal here is to map out decision making and lessons and create an interactive way to sort through it. [models](/site/models/)

# Welcome!
I'm Samuel (Sam) Flender, a scientist, ML practitioner, and writer. I created this website as a "one-stop-shop" to share some of my work.

## What I do for a living
As of October 2022, I'm an ML engineer at Meta. Before that, I was Applied Scientist at Amazon, and before that Data Scientist at JP Morgan Chase. Chase was my first industry job, and before that I was working in Academia, first as PhD student at the University of Helsinki, and then as postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois. My background is in Physics.

## What I write about 
I started writing about Machine Learning and Data Science back in 2019 when I was working as Data Scientist at Chase. At first I wanted to have a channel to write about my own learnings about ML and data science, but over time my blog evolved and included ML deep-dives as well.

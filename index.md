# Welcome!
I'm Bo Rhyne and this website is an attempt to centralize a few projects I want to work on. Most of these are projects I've wanted to do and don't want to shelf any longer. Covid seemed to shift my view on procrastination. In 2020, I started a company [Current Sets](https://currentsets.com/) and picked up the guitar. Both have been a long time coming!

## Mental models
My goal here is to map out decision making and lessons and create an interactive way to sort through it. [models](/site/models/)

## Music  
I'm a visual learner and also learn by doing. This was a weekend project to create a way to visualize the ways notes are organized on a guitar and to see some songs I've been learning in an interactive way. [music](/site/music/)

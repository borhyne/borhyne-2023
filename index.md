This website serves as a central place for my projects.


## [Models](/models/)
My goal here is to map out decision making and lessons and create an interactive way to sort through it.

## [Guitar](/guitar/)
This has been helpful to visualize the ways notes are organized and to simulate some fingerpicking songs I've been learning on acoustic guitar.

## [Current Sets](/cs/)
Current Sets helps people improve their construction documents before starting construction. As of mid 2023, we've helped 220+ projects avoid substantial rework, change orders, and schedule delays.

We started Current Sets after spending years working on-site at construction projects and building supporting construction technology.

A lot of platforms today exist to maintain a source of truth and follow project management fundamentals.

We feel the root of a lot of frustration in construction stems one layer deeper, in the quality of the construction documents.

## Why are there so many construction surprises?
- it takes a lot of time to understand design coordination and quality
- it's hard to efficiently communicate those problems with the design team
- a lot teams feel stuck and decide to fix it during construction
- which leads to rework, change orders, and schedule delays

## A better way?
We've been building a practical, fast, and cost effective way to check and improve cross discipline coordination and design quality and have come a long way in 3 years!

## Progress so far
We started in late 2020 and have since reviewed and helped to improve over $4B in construction value. We've built a platform that reduces the time to check for coordination substantially which has allowed us to help our customers avoid construction surprises.

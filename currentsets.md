We help people start construction projects from a place of design confidence.

We feel the root of a lot of frustration in construction stems one layer deeper that project management tools.

## Why are there so many surprises in construction?
- it takes a lot of time to setup for review, understand design coordination and quality
- it's hard to efficiently communicate those problems with the design team
- a lot teams feel stuck and decide to fix it during construction
- which leads to rework, change orders, and schedule delays

## A better way?
Our services offer a practical, fast, and cost effective way to check and improve cross discipline coordination and design quality. We're able to do this because of our internally developed platform we continue to improve with every review.

## Progress so far
We started in late 2020 and have since reviewed and helped to improve over $4B in construction value. We've built a platform that reduces the time to check for coordination substantially which has allowed us to help our customers avoid construction surprises.

## Idea
We started Current Sets because we were frustrated by the quality of drawings entering construction and wanted to help builders.

## Where are we?
We started in late 2023 and have since reviewed and helped to improve over $4B in construction value. We've built a platform to help check coordination and have reduced the time to check for coordination substantially.

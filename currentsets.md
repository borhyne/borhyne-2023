## Idea
We started Current Sets because we were frustrated by the quality of drawings entering construction and wanted to help builders.

## Progress so far
We started in late 2020 and have since reviewed and helped to improve over $4B in construction value. We've built a platform that reduces the time to check for coordination substantially which has allowed us to help our customers avoid construction surprises.

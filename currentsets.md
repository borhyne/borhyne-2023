We started Current Sets after working on construction projects and building construction projects.

We asked ourselves: why is it so difficult to understand and improve the coordination and quality of construction documents?

Project teams end up spending weeks / months of their time managing this process during construction.

On top of the administrative time, there's a larger impact to your project seen in rework, schedule delays, and hurt team morale.

## A better way?
We've been building a practical, fast, and cost effective way to check and improve cross discipline coordination and design quality and have come a long way in 3 years!

### We improve our platform and process on every review

### We've cut down on our set up time allowing us to spend more time reviewing

### Which helps us to do more high quality reviews in a format architects like working with

## Progress so far
We started in late 2020 and have since reviewed and helped to improve over $4B in construction value. We've built a platform that reduces the time to check for coordination substantially which has allowed us to help our customers avoid construction surprises.

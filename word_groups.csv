101,20,1,"The basics"
"Say what you mean, do what you say",32,1,"Be kind to your future self and only make commitments you can keep. Notice when you're not making commitments and re-evaluate which side is breaking down."
Show up on time,32,1,"To meetings, to Zoom calls. Show up on time and let the person know if you're running late. Don't make it a habit."
Better than most,32,1,"Do what you say and show up on time. That's step 1."
Be respectful with everyone,32,1,Be kind and treat everyone with respect.
You -> Average of 5 people,32,1,Who do you spend time with? They influence who you become.
Action,20,2,Your actions define who you are and who you become. Think about your actions and habits.
What you Do > Who you want to Be,32,2,Think about what you enjoy doing and do that. Who you want to be is a dream. Do what you enjoy and you will become someone you like.
Bias towards action, get stuff done,32,2,These are the people who are fun to work with. Be solution oriented and make it happen.
Done is better than perfect,32,2,Perfect gets in the way of getting important answers. Create a tight deadline for a first cut and push it through. You'll cut corners but you can get something functional into the wild. You'll save a ton of time and assumptions and learn from the people you show it to.
"Quick response -> crude, slow response -> perfect",32,2,"Quick responses make things happen and late responses lose momentum. When you're late, you feel the need to polish which can cause procrastination. At the same time, being glued to your phone isn't a way to live."
Mind + Body,20,3,"You've only got one body"
Health vs Wealth,32,3,"The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered 'Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.'"
Being present,32,3,"Focus on your breath and your five senses. Practice gratitude. Let go of things out of your control."
Say No,32,3,My typical response is Yes and have learned over time that saying No is a muscle that should be trained. No. is a complete sentence.
Managing,20,4,Motivating?
Autonomy, mastery of a skill, purpose,32,4,"Once people are paid enough, money does not motivate"
Mediocracy is a team killer,32,4,"Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Make the hard choices. Even when it's possible to punt. The inertia of mediocrity will not break unless you break it. What do you choose: Short term pain, long term gain or short term delay, long term pain?"
People perceive things in different ways,32,4,You can't assume what someone else is thinking. Don't make assumptions.
See things for what they are,32,4,It's easy to get caught up in the moment. Take a step back or even try to look down on the situation you are in (I'll visualize myself looking at the scene) from a different viewpoint. Usually whatever has you worked up isn't that important.
Perspective,20,5,How to look at things.
Dots get connected after,32,5,"People look to connect outcomes after they happen. Be yourself and do what you want. They can use the same trait to describe something good or bad that happens. Who cares what they think."
People have their own problems,32,5,"Everyone's world resolves around them. Look out for yourself and try not to be shaped by other peoples expectations. This is your life."
People remember how you make them feel,32,5,"Be kind and considerate. Surround yourself with people who treat you well."
Quality vs Speed vs Cost,32,5,"Pick 2. It's hard to balance all three. Think about the trade offs when you make decisions."
Does yourself at 80 care?,32,5,"Decisions you make today are small in the eyes of your 80 year old self. Making significant decisions from that view will help you avoid living with regret."
Planning,20,6,Not wasting time.
Solid building blocks,32,6,"Each section of code that you write should be rock solid. When things break, you know where you don’t need to look first. Accepting that there will be unexpected behavior with systems, code, organizations, or products helps to be ready for problem solving when they happen. When you’re troubleshooting with a clear head it’s easier to debug in smarter ways, like not checking 'solid building blocks' first."
Look at the facts,32,6,"It's easy to make emotional decisions. Try to be fact based. Write them down and weigh trade offs. This takes practice but is a skill you can hone."
Beauty in simplicity,32,6,"If it can't be built quickly it's too complicated. How do you manage process / features out?"
Luck is made,32,6,"People have always called me lucky. They don't pay attention to all of the things that don't work out. If you try enough and stay positive, some things will be successful."
Process wins,32,6,"Create simple processes and improve them when they break down."
Long term planning is guesswork,32,6,"Don't try to predict things that are too far away to predict. It's a waste of time."
